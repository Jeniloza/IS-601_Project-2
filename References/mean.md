#Mean

A mean is the simple mathematical average of a set of two or more numbers. The mean for a given set of numbers can be computed in more than one way, including the arithmetic mean method, which uses the sum of the numbers in the series, and the geometric mean method, which is the average of a set of products.

**Mean** **= x = ( Î£ xi ) / n**

The mean of a sample, or a population is computed by adding all the observations and dividing by the number of observations. Returning to the example of the five teenage boys, the mean weight would equal (100 + 100 + 130 + 140 + 150) / 5 = 620 / 5 = 124 pounds (56.25 kg).
