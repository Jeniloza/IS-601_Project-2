# Median


- The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average.
- The median is sometimes used as opposed to the mean when there are outliers in the sequence that might skew the average of the values.
- If there is an odd amount of numbers, the median value is the number that is in the middle, with the same amount of numbers below and above.
- If there is an even amount of numbers in the list, the middle pair must be determined, added together, and divided by two to find the median value.
